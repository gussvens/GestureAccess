How to run application on a device or emulator(we are not sure if the gesture works on all emulators as the app uses onboard imu cards):
1. Download project and open it in Android Studio.
2. Sync Gradle files if it is not done automatically.
3. Using an emulator or device with at least the minimum SDK version install the application.
4. The design is primaraly the prototype widget, so you are required to add the widget "Gesture access" to a pref. empty home screen page.
5. Depending on what applications the emulator/device has installed the icons displayed in the widget will differ.
6. Tapping an icon will open the 'Gesture access' application, where a gesture promt will be displayed as well as the difficuty level and the current progress.
7. Before the timer runs out, perform the gesture(we are not sure this is possible on an emulator) until you reach 100% progress.
